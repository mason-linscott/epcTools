\title{Identify shifts on branches of a phylogenetic tree}
\usage{
identifyBranches(tree, n, fixed.loc = TRUE, plot.simmap = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An object of class 'phylo'}

\item{n}{The number of shifts to map interactively onto the phylogeny}

\item{fixed.loc}{A logical indicating whether the exact location on the branch should be returned, or the shift will be free to move along the branch}

\item{plot.simmap}{A logical indicating whether the resulting painting of regimes should be plotted following the selection shift location.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with elements "sb" which contains the branch numbers of all selected branches with length "n". If "fixed.loc=TRUE", then the list also
contains a vector "loc" which contains the location of the selected shifts along the branch.
}
\description{
This is a convenience function for mapping regimes interactively on the phylogeny. The method locates the nearest branch to where the
cursor is clicked on the plot and records the branch number and the location selected on the branch.
}
\details{
\code{identifyBranches} opens an interactive phylogeny plot that allows the user to specify the location
of shifts in a phylogenetic tree.
